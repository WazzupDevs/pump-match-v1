GHOSTFACE PROTOCOL: TRUST SCORE & MATCHING SPECIFICATION (v1)Version: 1.0 (Frozen)Status: Production ReadyArchitecture: Consent-Based Identity Layer1. Core PhilosophyGhostface is not a blockchain explorer. It is a Reputation & Identity Layer for Solana.Identity over Assets: We measure behavior and reputation, not just balance.Consent First: Only users who strictly opt-in are indexed in the Match Registry.Weak Link Principle: In a squad, the risk is defined by the least trustworthy member.2. The Trust Score Formula (Determinist)The final "Match Confidence" is not an average. It is a weighted calculation designed to punish asymmetry in trust levels.$$Score_{final} = \min(98, \text{BaseScore} + \text{BadgeBonus} + \text{IntentBonus})$$A. Base Score (The Weak Link)We do not take a simple average. A high-trust user cannot fully de-risk a low-trust user.$Min = \min(User_{trust}, Match_{trust})$$Max = \max(User_{trust}, Match_{trust})$Formula: $\text{BaseScore} = (Min \times 0.7) + (Max \times 0.3)$B. Badge Bonuses (Capped at +25)Badges are signals of identity. They are split into two categories:SYSTEM Badges (On-Chain Reality):Derived from immutable data (Balance, Tx History, Age).Weight: Full Value (e.g., Whale = +6).SOCIAL Badges (Off-Chain Reputation):Derived from community endorsements.Anti-Sybil Decay: To prevent spam, social badges suffer diminishing returns.Decay Factor: [1.0, 0.6, 0.3] (1st badge: 100%, 2nd: 60%...).C. Intent Bonus (Capped at +20)Reputation is useless without alignment. We reward Complementary Roles via an Asymmetric Matrix.Dev ↔ Whale: +20 (Funding Fit)Whale ↔ Dev: +25 (Product Fit)Dev ↔ Dev: +5 (Neutral/Peer Review)Competition Logic: Find Funding ↔ Find Funding results in 0 Bonus (Neutral), never negative penalty in MVP.3. Privacy & Security ArchitectureA. The "Ghost" Mode (Default)Any wallet can be analyzed.Restriction: Scanned wallets are NEVER saved to the database.Outcome: Read-only analysis, no matching visibility.B. The "Network" Mode (Opt-In)User must explicitly sign/click "Join Network".Data Stored: Wallet Address, Join Date (Immutable), Intent, Active Badges.Visibility: User becomes visible to others based on Trust Tier.C. Anti-Probing DefensesSnapshot Caching: Match results are cached for 5 minutes.Rate Limiting: Prevents malicious actors from mapping the social graph via rapid queries.4. Future Roadmap (Post-v1)v1.1: Behavioral Intent Analysis (AI-driven intent detection).v1.2: Retroactive Slashing (If a squad rugs, members lose Trust Score).v2.0: On-Chain Attestation (Moving badges to Solana Program).
